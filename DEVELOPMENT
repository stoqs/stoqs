Notes for developing, extending, and testing STOQS

You should already have completed the tasks described in PREREQUISITES and INSTALL.

STOQS is meant to be customizable and easy to extend to handle data, perform queries,
and deliver products that suit several particular needs.  A knowledge of Python, and
the supporting Django, PyDAP, Numpy libraries is needed to take full advantage of these
capabilities; but with the agile methodology described here you should feel confident
in making changes that you 'think might work'.


1. Directory structure overview:
	
	stoqsproj/
		loaders/		- Data load scripts and class files (e.g. DAPloaders.py) for
					  	  for loading data into STOQS from various sources
		static/			- Directory to hold uploaded media 
		stoqs/			- Contains STOQS data model and other python support code
			fixtures/ 	- JSON formatted database data used for tests
			templates/	- HTML templates used by views
		views/			- Contains Python code to render data in web responses
		urls.py			- 
		
	New development of STOQS will occur mainly in the loaders and views directories.
	There may be times when models.py in stoqs/ will be modified, but this must be
	done carefully as it needs to be coordinated with schema evolution of any existing
	stoqs databases.
		

2. Edit, compile, deploy, test process:

   	First, start your development Django and Celery servers (in separate windows):
   
   		python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   		python manage.py celeryd -l INFO
   	
   	Second, save a change to code in the view package.  The change is immediately compiled
   	and deployed by the running Django development server.  There is no need to restart anything.
   	(Note: in a production environment with Apache WSGI, the httpd server does need to be
   	restarted in order to deploy the changed code.)
   
   	Third, run the Django unit tests (NOTE: Django patch #16778 must be installed for this to work):
   
    	python manage.py test stoqs -v 2
    
   	If they all pass you are good.  If you get a failure, fix it and then repeat the test.
   	Iterate on these last two steps.  You may also test the links from the activities and
   	mgmt views.  If there is missing coverage for a needed test please add it to stoqs/tests.
   
   
3. Additional notes:
	
	- Need to use Django 2.4.1 because of fight between psycopg and Django developers
	- For tests to work you must apply patch at:
	  	https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/16778 to adapter.py which is applied to file:
	  	venv-stoqs/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Django-1.3-py2.6.egg/django/contrib/gis/db/backends/postgis/adapter.py
  
	- The data from the database loaded by the DAPloaders test may be dumped into a JSON file 
	  which is used as a fixture for the unit tests:

		python manage.py dumpdata --database=default stoqs > stoqs/fixtures/stoqs_test_data.json
		
	- There is no unit test for the code in loaders.  The loaders code manually selects the database
	  using Django's 'using=<dbalias>' technique.  Django's test runner uses the automated database 
	  routing framework as implemented in stoqs/db_router.py and the <dbName> pattern in urls.py.

	- Model changes (adding new relations, etc.) may require starting over with creating and syncing
	  a database then loading some data, creating a new fixture, and testing.
