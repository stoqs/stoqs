Notes for installing STOQS on a production server

You should already have completed the tasks described in PREREQUISITES and INSTALL.

STOQS can be installed on a standard Apache httpd web server employing the wsgi module.
Here are the steps:

1. Add a stoqs.conf file to the server's /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory.  With this 
   configuration the system administrator can assign sudo priveledges to administrator
   of the STOQS application, and he/she can make changes without affecting the master
   httpd.conf.
   
   
2. Add these lines to the stoqs.conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d/:

WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi

WSGIDaemonProcess stoqs user=apache group=root threads=25
WSGIProcessGroup stoqs

# Map web server path to location of the stoqs.wsgi file:
# WSGIScriptAlias /<parent_web_site> <path_to_stoqs.wsgi_file>, e.g.:
# WSGIScriptAlias /canon /home/student/dev/stoqsproj/stoqs.wsgi
# (Uncomment above line, edited with web parent and stoqs.wsgi location)
 

3. Edit privateSettings if the DATABASE_* settings are different.  (Your Postgres
   server will most likely may have tighter access controls in a production environment.)
   
   Make sure that you have DEBUG set to False
   
   
4. Test as with a DEVELOPMENT installation:

	python manage.py test stoqs
	
	Interact with the activities and measurement requests to get data
