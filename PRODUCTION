Notes for installing STOQS on a production server

You should already have completed the tasks described in PREREQUISITES and INSTALL.

STOQS can be installed on a standard Apache httpd web server employing the wsgi module.
Here are the steps:

1. Add a stoqs.conf file to the server's /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory.  With this 
   configuration the system administrator can assign sudo priveledges to administrator
   of the STOQS application, and he/she can make changes without affecting the master
   httpd.conf.
   
   
2. Add these lines to the stoqs.conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d/:

WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi

WSGIDaemonProcess stoqs user=apache group=root threads=25
WSGIProcessGroup stoqs

# Map web server path to location of the stoqs.wsgi file:
# WSGIScriptAlias /<parent_web_site> <path_to_stoqs.wsgi_file>, e.g.:
# WSGIScriptAlias /canon /home/student/dev/stoqsproj/stoqs.wsgi
# (Uncomment above line, edited with web parent and stoqs.wsgi location)


3. Edit privateSettings if the DATABASE_* settings are different.  (Your Postgres
   server will most likely may have tighter access controls in a production environment.)
   
   Make sure that you have DEBUG set to False
   
4. Copy static files to the production web server location off of it's document_root.
   The STATIC_ROOT in settings.py must be writable by the user that executes this command:

    python manage.py collectstatic


5. Create the STATIC_ROOT/media/sections and STATIC_ROOT/media/parameterparameter directories. 
   (These are used by matplotlib for data visualization for the UI.)  They need to be
   writable by the owner of the httpd process.  This can be done on a typical CentOS 
   install with these commands:

    mkdir -p /var/www/html/stoqs/media/sections/
    mkdir -p /var/www/html/stoqs/media/parameterparameter/
    chmod 733 /var/www/html/stoqs/media/sections/
    chmod 733 /var/www/html/stoqs/media/parameterparameter/


6. Restart the apache web server:

    sudo /sbin/service httpd restart


7. Test the STOQS user interface at URL:

    http://<your_server_name>/canon/


TODO: Instructions for setting up celery to run as a daemon. (Note: celery is used for managing 
      long running processes, as of 25 February 2013 stoqs has no such processes.  This is a
      placeholder should stoqs develop long running processes in the future.)
