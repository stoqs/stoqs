============

The STOQS User Interface provides some functionality for exploring the data within a campaign.
Often more involved analisys and visualization requires a "closer intimacy" with the data.
This can be achieved by direct access to the data by scripting using Python, Django, and SQL.

The recommended environment is CentOS 6, though other Linux distributions will also work.
 

CentOS 6:
---------

Follow the instructions in the PREREQUESITES file. If your organization supports a STOQS 
database server hosting campaign databases that you plan to use then the steps for installing
PostgreSQL and PostGIS may be skipped. These additional installations are helpful for performing
data analysis and visualization:

Activate your virtual environment: source venv-stoqs/bin/activate

sudo yum install tkinter
pip install shapely
pip install cython
sudo yum install geos-devel
git clone https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy.git
cd cartopy
python setup.py install

# Follow instructions for installing Basemap at http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html
sudo yum install geos-devel
export GEOS_DIR=/usr
tar -xvzf basemap-1.0.7.tar
cd basemap-1.0.7
python setup.py install

pip install OWSLib
