Instructions for contributing to the STOQS project
==================================================

You are encouraged to contribute to STOQS!

You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Basic Unix, Python (server-side), JavaScipt (client-side), and Shell programming skills 
are required to effectively contribute to STOQS.  There are great resources for learning these 
skills at https://software-carpentry.org.  The good news is that Unix system administration 
skills are no longer required as `vagrant up --provider virtualbox` takes care of 
installing all the required software.

### Setting up your development system
 
1. Build a development Linux system -- the [Vagrantfile installation](../../README.md)
   saves a lot of time and frustration in doing this

2. Fork the repository after logging into GitHub by clicking on the Fork button at 
   https://github.com/stoqs/stoqs

3. Recommended: Generate SSH keys on your development system following the instructions at 
   https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

4. Rename the existing `origin` remote to `upstream`:

        cd ~/dev/stoqsgit
        git remote rename origin upstream

5. Assign `origin` remote to your forked repository:

        git remote add -f origin <your_github_clone_url>

   Replace \<your_github_clone_url\> with "Copy to clipboard" from GitHub web site

### Contributing follows a [typical GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):

1. cd into your working directory, e.g.:

        cd ~/dev/stoqsgit

2. Create a branch for the new feature: 

        git checkout master
        git checkout -b my_new_feature

3. Work on your feature; add and commit as you write code and test it. (Creating a new 
   branch is not strictly necessary, but it makes it easy to delete your branch when 
   the feature has been merged into upstream, diff your branch with the version that 
   actually ended in upstream, and to submit pull requests for multiple features (branches)).

4. Before pushing the commits of your new feature please run `./test.sh` to make sure 
   the test coverage has not decreased.  Another way to state this is: Be sure to write 
   a test for your new feature in stoqs/stoqs/tests.

5. Push the new branch to your fork on GitHub:

        git push origin my_new_feature

6. Share your contribution with others by issuing a 
   [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/): Click the 
   Pull Request button from your forked repository on GitHub

### Synchronizing with upstream

You should periodically pull changes to your workspace from the upstream remote.  These 
commands will synchronize your fork with upstream, including any local changes you have
committed:

    git pull upstream master
    git push origin

After this you can use the GitHub web interface to visualize differences between your 
fork and upstream and submit a Pull Request.

If a lot of changes have happened upstream and you have local commits that you have 
not made public you may want to do a `rebase` instead of `merge`.  A `rebase` will 
replay your local changes on top of what is in upstream, e.g.:

    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/master

or 
    `git rebase upstream/<branch_name>`, if a lot of upstream development is happening on another branch 

WARNING: This will rewrite commit history, so should only be done if your local commits 
have not been made public.
