DEBUG and OPTIMIZE
==================

Suggestions for debugging, identifying performance bottlenecks and tips for optimizing
performance, especially of the queries made against the postgresql database.

You should be in a place to run the stoqs application as descibed in DEVELOPMENT.

While developing the stoqs application it's useful to have several separate shell windows
open in order to monitor log files, enter sample queries to postgresql, and edit and
check in code.

Shell window environment
------------------------
Here's a list of such shells to leave open uring development (access to several of these 
files requires relevant permissions - on a development system you can use root):

    1. The development server: "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
       INFO and DEBUG output from stoqs and django loggers go here.
       (In production that output goes to apache's error_log file.)

    2. A psql prompt connected to the database: "psql" command as user postgres, and
       \c stoqs_june2011, for example.

    3. The mapserver log file: "tail -f /tmp/mapserver_stoqshg.log"

    4. The apache access_log file: "tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log"

    5. The postgresql log file, e.g.: "tail -f /var/lib/pgsql/9.1/data/pg_log/postgresql-Mon.log"
       To see queries as they are executed on the database edit the configuration file 
       /var/lib/pgsql/9.1/data/postgresql.conf and change the line:
           log_statement = 'none'
       to:
           log_statement = 'all'
       then reload the new configuration with: "/sbin/service postgresql-9.1 reload"

       NOTE: Make sure to set this back to 'none' before executing a production data load, 
             the resulting log file will likely fill up your disk.

    6. Open a web browser with developer tools open (Chrome with alt-cmd-I or Firefox with
       firebug) and load pages (such as http://localhost:8000/default/query) and
       observe the output in each of the windows.  If you are running in a VM (don't we
       all do that now?) you can use your host OS to run the web browser using the IP
       address instead of 'localhost'.  Executing an 'arp -a' in yout host OS will show 
       the IP address to use.

    7. As many more windows as you like to edit code and check your changes in.  Check in
       working code often.  Make sure all unit tests pass before doing an 'hg push'.


Debugging and optimizing
------------------------
The end of your privateSettings file will have lines like these:

    # Setting PRODUCTION to True ensures that performace-affecting settings are turned off
    PRODUCTION = False

    # Use 'manage.py collectstatic' to put files in the production location so that DEBUG = False works on the development server.
    # See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6405173/static-files-wont-load-when-out-of-debug-in-django
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG = False         

    # Modify default logging settings, e.g. to help in debugging stoqs or django, ignored is DEBUG is False
    # Note: Must restart the development server for changes made here to take effect
    if DEBUG:
        LOGGING['loggers']['django']['level'] = 'INFO'
        LOGGING['loggers']['stoqs']['level'] = 'DEBUG'
        LOGGING['loggers']['stoqs.db_router']['level'] = 'INFO'
        LOGGING['loggers']['utils']['level'] = 'DEBUG'

To enable debugging for a component set TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG = True and for the component you are
debugging (django, stoqs, stoqs.db_router, utils, etc.) set its level to 'DEBUG'.

Setting django's level to 'DEBUG' will generate a lot of output as each SQL statement will be output,
though it is a pseudo-SQL variant - not something you can cut and paste into your psql prompt.
This can be useful to observe what Django is doing under the hood.  It was real helpful when a 
'.select_related()' was missing in a query set definition in measurement.py.  It was easy to see
that Django was issuing several separate SELECT statements rather than constructing a single query 
with INNER JOINS.  Fixing this impoved performance by more than an order of madnitude.

To see the exact SQL that postgresql executes examine the postgresql log output in window #5.  If you
see one of these queries taking a long time to execute you can understand why by pasting it into your 
psql prompt with 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE ' prepended and ';' appended.  Some examples of where this was
done are in the comments of utils/STOQSQManager.py.  Massive performance gains were achieved by
changing the queries to hit the summary Activity information rather than get results from the 
instantpoint and measurement tables - which have millions of records in them in a typical database.

If you have a long-running query executing you may be "lucky" enough to obseve the actual SQL by
examinging the current connections on the database with the psql commnd:

    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
